Your first task is to read [[https://rickneff.github.io/the-problem-of-the-hats.html][this statement of a puzzle]] (that is most likely a
  problem for you --- NOT an exercise!).

  Then ponder and discuss with your groupmates which of the three choices is
  the correct one.

  Use good, logical reasoning, and realize that to properly prove that one
  choice is correct you must also show why the other choices are incorrect.

  Each of you individually answer the survey question when it is made available.
