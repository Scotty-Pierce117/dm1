** Compare/Contrast 
  A compare/contrast exercise is one where you have two or more things that have
  similarities and differences. Your task is to explain these similarities and
  differences. Bear in mind that to be responsive at all there should be at
  least one point of comparison (telling how they are the same) and at least one
  point of contrast (telling how they are different), and preferably two or more
  of each.
** A Familiar Problem
  Recall the /polygon circumscribing/ (AKA /limiting radius/) problem? The
  limiting radius (r_\infty) of the outermost circle is 8.700 (approximately).

  There are reasons finding the value of this radius is an exercise/problem in
  /discrete/ mathematics (one is because algorithms are step-by-step discrete
  things, another is that the answer can only be given with finite precision,
  which is a discrete math idea) and there are reasons for it being /continuous/
  mathematics (because you can do it without a computer, and the answer is a
  /real/ number, which is a continuous math idea). In other words, it depends!

  Whether or not this was an [[https://rickneff.github.io/exercises-versus-problems.html][exercise (versus a problem)]] depends on if on first
  contact you immediately knew how to answer it or not!

  Below are two computational solutions to this problem, one in C++, one in
  elisp. The exercise is to compare and contrast the two.

  using namespace std;

  double limitingRadius(long numSides)
  {
     double radius = 1.0;
     for (long i = 3; i < numSides; i++)
     {
        radius /= cos(M_PI / i);
     }
     return radius;
  }

  int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
  {
     int n = (argc < 2) ? global_num : atol(argv[1]);
     clock_t start = clock();
     double result = limitingRadius(n);
     clock_t end = clock();
     cout << "Calculated " << setprecision(17) << result
          << " with " << n << " iterations in "
          << (end - start) / (double) CLOCKS_PER_SEC
          << " seconds.\n";
     return 0;
  }

** A Fascinating History
  This problem has a fascinating history, presented in /The Math Book/ by
  Clifford Pickover, and excerpted for your consideration, profit and learning
