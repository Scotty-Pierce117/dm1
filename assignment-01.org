  are 3:1, 5:2, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 5:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, and infinity (3:0).

   Numbers and words. Cycles and patterns.

   Do you think mathematicians discover or invent patterns? While pondering that
   question, consider what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] famously wrote: /A mathematician, like a
   painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent/
   /than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas/. What do you think he
   meant by that?

   Here\rsquo{}s a puzzle superficially just involving a 6-digit number and a 6-letter
   \ldquo{}word\rdquo. What does

   654321

   have to do with

   CLAHCK

   other than they both follow the \ldquo{}length 6\rdquo pattern?
