  #+ATTR_HTML: :alt desert image :title What is this doing here?!
  [[file:../img/desert.jpg]]

  This is the first of many exercises/problems/puzzles to come, always displayed
  in this type of yellow-background box.

  Propose a connection between discrete mathematics and the image above.
  (This is a \ldquo{}free association\rdquo exercise --- there is no right answer.)
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  From the limited experience that I’ve had with discrete math so far, 
  the desert represents the hot and cold nature that students experience while 
  learning discrete math.  Throughout a twenty-four-hour cycle, a desert goes through
  two main temperature cycles, especially during the non-winter months.  A desert can be
  blistering hot during the day and freezing cold at night.  The learning process in discrete math can be similar.  
  At times, the student can feel on fire, loving the class, feeling smart and excelling in
  the problem solving.  At other time, they are cold.  The progress is slow, the brain is frozen, and they are extremely uncomfortable.

  The operation called /dehydration/ takes a word and deletes all letters in it
  from H to O. What is the original (rehydrated) text of this dehydrated
  sequence of words?

  AD GS AD WY TE SEA S BG T AD WETER PGS AVE WGS

#+begin_info
  Interestingly enough, after looking at two distinct dehydrated words, “WARUS” and “CABBAGES”,
  I recalled a memory of my grade school years at charter school.  We were required to memorize 
  multiple poems throughout the school year.  I knew this was from some sort of poem, so I searched
  “walrus cabbage poem” and bam.  Stanza 65 from Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland” which says 
  “The time has come,” the Walrus said, “To talk of many things: Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax
  Of cabbages—and kings—And why the sea is boiling hot—And whether pigs have wings.”

#+begin_note
  Let $n / 0$ be infinity, for any positive integer /n/.

  What English word has the largest /finite/ consonant-vowel-ratio (CVR)? For
  example, the CVRs of the words (including the TLA) in the previous sentence
  are 3:1, 5:2, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 5:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, and infinity (3:0).
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  I was trying to think of words with few syllables, because typically there are multiple vowels when 
  there are multiple syllables.  Then I searched single-syllable words with the most consonants, and I 
  found the word “strengths”, which has 8:1 consonant to vowel ratio.

  In the figure below, the innermost circle has radius 1. It is circumscribed by
  an equilateral triangle, which is circumscribed by a circle, which is
  circumscribed by a square, which is circumscribed by yet another circle, and
  so forth.

  [[file:../img/circumscribed-polygons-and-circles.png][file:../img/circumscribed-polygons-and-circles.png]]

  What is the radius of the outermost circle?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  I used excel to compute the circle.  I created a somewhat infinite series based upon
  the ratio of around 0.82, which I figured out by calculating the first three circle radiuses.
  I then used that ratio to compute the diameter as the change approached zero, which was around 6.55.

** TODO DOK
#+begin_note
  Pick a number (a positive integer). Form the product of that number, one more
  than that number, and one more than twice that number. Repeat for several
  different numbers. There is a pattern to these products. What is it?

   Numbers and words. Cycles and patterns.

   Do you think mathematicians discover or invent patterns? While pondering that
   question, consider what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] famously wrote: /A mathematician, like a
   painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent/
   /than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas/. What do you think he
   meant by that?

   Here\rsquo{}s a puzzle superficially just involving a 6-digit number and a 6-letter
   \ldquo{}word\rdquo. What does

   654321

   have to do with

   CLAHCK

   other than they both follow the \ldquo{}length 6\rdquo pattern?
