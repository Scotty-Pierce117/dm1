* Relations
** As defined by [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Relation.html][Wolfram Mathworld]]

  A relation is any subset of a Cartesian product. For instance, a subset of
  A×B, called a "binary relation from A to B," is a collection of ordered
  pairs (a,b) with first components from A and second components from B, and,
  in particular, a subset of A×A is called a "relation on A." For a binary
  relation R, one often writes aRb to mean that (a,b) is in R×R.

  In mathematics, an n-ary relation on n sets, is any subset of Cartesian
  product of the n sets. The relation is homogeneous when it is formed with
  one set. For example any curve in the Cartesian plane is a subset of the
  Cartesian product of real numbers, RxR. The homogeneous binary relations are
  studied for properties like reflexiveness, symmetry, and transitivity which
  determine different kinds of orderings on the set. Heterogeneous n-ary
  relations, are used in the semantics of predicate calculus, and in
  relational databases.

  In relational databases jargon, the relations are called tables. There is a
  relational algebra consisting in the operations on sets, because relations
  are sets, extended with operators like projection, which forms a new
  relation selecting a subset of the columns (tuple entries) in a table, the
  selection operator, which selects just the rows (tuples),according to some
  condition, and join which works like a composition operator.

  The use of the term "relation" is often used as shorthand to refer to binary
  relations, where the set of all the starting points is called the domain and
  the set of the ending points is the codomain.

  But see also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation][Full-Blown Wikipedia]].  
** By the book
   A \times B, the *Cartesian product* (or just product) of set A with set B
   is the set of all ordered pairs (a b) where a \in A and b \in B. This
   generalizes to n > 2 sets in a straightforward way.

   A *binary relation* R from a set A to a set B is a subset: R \sube A \times B.

   A binary relation R /on a set/ A (a *self relation*) is a subset of A \times A,
   or a relation from A to A (from the set to itself).

   For an A \times B example:

   - A = [a b c]
   - B = [1 2 3]
   - R = [(a 1) (a 2) (b 2) (b 3) (c 3)]

   For a self relation example:

   - A = [a b c]
   - R = [(a a) (a b) (a c)]
