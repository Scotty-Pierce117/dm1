  How does allowing cycles imply the existence of more than one path from one
  graph node to another?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  Cycles imply that to return back to a node, it does not take a "there and back" solution, rather
  that it makes some sort of circular solution.  If there is a cycle, that means that that node
  can either be gotten back to through following the cycle or by backstepping.

  Which node in the directed graph below represents Abu in the ping-pong
  tournament he was in?
  [[file:../img/fig-tournament-graph.png]]
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  Probably node A.  Becuase it is connected to each and every other node on the graph,
  that is why.  It could also possibly be represented with G, becuase each and every node
  on the graph points to it.

#+begin_note
  Do some research and figure out where graphs are used in your major, and describe
  how a knowledge of graph theory can be beneficial to you in the future.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  One very important place they are used is in state machines.  State machines show relationships
  between different states while showing a finite number of them.  The state changes from one to 
  another through input, and the input determines the next state.

  Choose a link in the directed (tournament) graph above (figure 51 in HTC). Use
  all of the /directed adjacency/ vocabulary to describe it.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  I pick C.
  C is adjacent to D, E, F and G.
  C is adjacent from A and B
  k, i, j, and l come from C.
  k i j l go to D, E, F, G
  k i j l connect C to D E F G
  k i j l go from C to D E F G
  C is the initial node of k i j l
  D E F G are terminal nodes of k i j l

  What is the degree sequence of the wheel graph W_5? What is it in general for a
  W_n?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  It has 5 nodes with 3 links each.  [5 3 3 3 3 3 ]
  
  N is simmilar, with n at the front followed by n 3's.

  =NM=, identifying the shortest path(s) and the longest path(s).

#+begin_note
  Directed graphs (/digraphs/ for short) can represent binary relations. Make a
  connection between the four relation types and the existence or non-existence
  of certain features in the graph of the relation.

  - Reflexive = /every/ node has a link that is a loop.
  - Symmetric = there are /no/ single link arrows (one-way trips) --- every link
    arrow is a double one (roundtrip).
  - Antisymmetric = there is /no/ double arrow (going both ways) /unless/ it is
    a loop.
  - Transitive = there is /no/ two-leg journey (think flight with a layover)
    without a shortcut (non-stop flight).

  It is helpful to draw a graph of a relation that is described more abstractly.
  For an example of an abstract description, here is the relation on the set [1
  2 3] given by this vector of \ldquo{}conses\rdquo (another way to say /dotted pairs/)
  representing the ordered pairs:

  [(1 . 1) (1 . 2) (2 . 2) (3 . 3)]

  And here is the three-node four-link graph of that relation:
  [[file:../img/fig-digraph-of-binary-relation.png]]

  Identify which features listed above this graph has. Draw the digraphs of some
  other abstract binary relations, with and without the four features.

  In another multigraph example, what is the connection between this graph and
  the \ldquo{}birth of graph theory\rdquo?

  [[file:../img/fig-four-nodes-seven-links.png]]

  What do its nodes and links represent? What is its degree sequence?

  Explore the graph property \ldquo{}Eulerian\rdquo. Does this graph have it? Describe
  necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Eulerian.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  The graph displayed is the same graph as described with the bridges.  Nodes represent
  land, links represent bridges.  [3 3 3 3].  It is not a Eulerian graph, becuase it can't 
  be traversed from one vertex and come back to that same vertex without re-trversing others.

#+begin_note
  Explore the question: Does a graph\rsquo{}s degree sequence alone contain enough
  information to reconstruct the graph?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  A graph can be constructed from a degree sequence alone, however, different graphs
  can have the same dgree sequence.

#+begin_note
  Is there (can there exist) a simple graph with degree sequence =[3 2 1 0]=?
  Justify your answer.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  No,  because in order for the first node to have three connections, and since there are
  only 3 other nodes, all of them would have to be connected to it.  Since one of the nodes
  has zero connections, it cannot be connected to that first node, therefore this graph does
  not exist!

** TODO HBT *
#+begin_note
  List in lisp form (using the shorter representation) all the directed paths in
  the tournament graph from node =A= to node =F=. How many of these paths
