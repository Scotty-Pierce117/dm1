  Make a connection between the logical conditional operator (\rightarrow) and the
  /definition/ of a subset. Refer to the three numbered regions in your answer.
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Making this connection means: 1) express the logical conditional
            operator in terms of the definition of subset, or 2) express subset
            in terms of the definition of the logical conditional operator,
            whichever makes the most sense to you. Express either (or both) in
            terms of the three numbered regions.

  - More Emphatically :: Making this connection will help you understand why the
       conditional operator works the way it does. To answer fully, you /must/
       give the definition of a subset, and you /must/ refer to the three
       numbered regions in the Venn diagram.

  The symbol -> means that if the thing on the thing on the left is true, the thing on the right
  is also true.  That means that is U is true, 1 is true.  Becuase B is a subset of U, B is true as
  well making 2 true.  A is a subset of B, so A is true if B is true, making 3 true as well.  That means
  A -> B -> U.

#+begin_note
  The way to deal with lisp expressions is to look for lists, and when found,
  evaluate them. Finding them is easy --- lisp code consists of lists, and lists
  of lists nested to many levels. Evaluating a list entails evaluating each of
  its elements, except the first, which is treated differently. For now, think
  of the first element as an operator that operates on the values of the rest of
  the elements. These values are called the operands. So =(+ 1 2 3 4)= adds
  together operands 1, 2, 3, and 4 to produce 10. Note the economy of this
  /prefix/ notation, as it\rsquo{}s called: only one mention of the =+= sign is needed.
  The more familiar /infix/ notation requires redundant =+= signs, as in
  =1+2+3+4=.

  Now is the time to overcome inertia and gain some momentum with elisp. Find at
  [[file:elisp-mini-primer.org][this link a mini-primer]] and work through it in emacs.
:HINT:
  - Hint :: You will be well served to work through this mini-primer carefully
